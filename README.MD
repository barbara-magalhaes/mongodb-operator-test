# MongoDB Community Kubernetes Operator 
This is a [MongoDB Operator](https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes-operator/) which deploys MongoDB Community into Kubernetes clusters.

ðŸ“œ About
 The project follows the official MongoDB Community Operator documentation to create a MongoDB cluster, including StatefulSet resources for scaling and resource management (CPU and memory).
 I used K3s (https://k3s.io/) and Lens(https://k8slens.dev/)  as a laboratory for implementing and creating the cluster. I used the official documentation with kubectl.
