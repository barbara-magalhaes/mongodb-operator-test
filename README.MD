# MongoDB Community Kubernetes Operator 
This is a [Kubernetes Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) which deploys MongoDB Community into Kubernetes clusters.

## About
 Test repository for the Mongodb Community Operator. I used K3s(https://k3s.io/) and Lens(https://k8slens.dev/)  as a laboratory for implementing and creating the cluster. I used the official documentation with kubectl.
